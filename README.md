This project involves the development of a weather app using React Native and incorporating the use of Tailwind CSS for improved user interface design. The app will rely on an external API to fetch real-time weather data and present it in an intuitive and visually appealing manner.

Using React Native as the framework enables cross-platform development, allowing the app to be deployed on both iOS and Android devices. With its component-based architecture and efficient performance, React Native ensures a seamless user experience.

The app integrates with WeatherAPI, to retrieve accurate and up-to-date weather information. Users will be able to access current weather conditions and a 3-day forecast, enabling them to plan their activities accordingly. The development process involves setting up the development environment, designing the user interface, implementing necessary components and features, integrating the API, and conducting thorough testing to ensure reliability.
